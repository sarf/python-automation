## `one-offs`

Contains my one-off scripts, which may be fully functional or just functional enough for me. Your mileage may vary (and should!).

While the aim for the scripts is to be self-contained, they may require some pip-installing to work. 
Someday they'll even tell you that themselves, perhaps even in a standardized format. A man can dream...
